# MC_SVTimeScale
  
Backup your save before using any mods.  
  
Uninstall any mods and attempt to replicate issues before reporting any suspected base game bugs on official channels.  

Function
====
Speed up game time scale in increments or by holding a key.  
  
This mod increases the whole game's run speed.  It is not a speed booster plus.  If a hard hitting enemy wants you dead, you wont escape, you'll die faster.
  
Additionally, the game uses built-in timers which expect "normal" time progression for things like energy generation, shield regeneration, weapon heat disappation etc.  This 
mod currently does not compensate for "skipped" updates in this regard.  It is mainly for getting around at a less painful speed.  
  
Be cautious about very large values.  The mod has no built-in cap.
